Predicting whether a customer is more likely to default or honor their bank loan

This repository consists of the jupyter notebook that goes through the process of exploratory data analysis and three different classification models in order to predict whether a customer defaulted or not.

Also included is a functioning flask API, which allows you to to input a few basic features, and then click on a button to predict your outcome based on one of the models I used.
